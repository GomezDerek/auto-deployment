Veida AI's Deployment Script
============================
With this bash script, *a single command* will transfer code from your local development repo into your local frontend and backend production repos that Vercel and Raleway are remotely hosting, respectively. 

Quick Set-Up
------------
Specify your arguments in `args.txt`. In this file, specify the filepaths for your local production repos. 

The API urls have already been set by default.
The dev directory paths have been hard-coded into `execute.sh`

Deploy!
------
run `bash deploy/execute.sh`
watch the magic happen
enjoy the extra freetime you have now that **deployment has been automated!**
